# CABSdock protein-peptide-global-docking-evaluation
During global docking simulation (CABSdock in this study) the search for the receptorâ€“peptide binding mode is limited to the broad area of protein surface. Thus a local docking tool (ADCP in this study) was used to refine the binding mode prediction based on top-scored binding interface from CABSdock.
